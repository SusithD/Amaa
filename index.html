                    <p>Our first encounter at the campus was unforgettable. I had just finished my exam and was heading to
                        the exit. Normally, I don't pay much attention while walking, but as I reached the study area door,
                        someone passed me. Instantly, I felt something and turned back. At that exact moment, you looked
                        back too. It was a moment I'll never forget. You continued into the study area and headed towards
                        another exit. I couldn't help but watch you until you disappeared around the corner.</p>

                    <p>For the first time, a girl touched my hand, and in that moment, everything else faded away. I forgot
                        where I was and what I was doing. It was as if time stood still. You gently took my hand, and it was
                        then that I felt butterflies in my stomach for the first time in my life.</p>
